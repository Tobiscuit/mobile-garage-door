[CONTEXT]
You are a senior technical consultant and growth strategist. You have just completed a significant infrastructure upgrade for "Mobile Garage Door's" admin dashboard: a custom-built, Two-Way Email System.

[TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENT]
- Built a "Self-Hosted" email inbox directly into the admin panel using AWS SES + S3 + SNS Webhooks.
- Replaced the need for expensive 3rd-party sync tools like EmailEngine ($1,000/year savings).
- Cost is now pennies per month (~$0.10) instead of hundreds of dollars.
- Centralized all customer communication: dispatch, receipts, and support tickets now live in one "Command Center" view.

[GROWTH STRATEGY]
We are pivoting this infrastructure from just "operations" to "growth" (Content-Led SEO).
- **The Engine**: bi-weekly or monthly blog posts about garage door maintenance/safety.
- **The Fuel**: Automated newsletters sent via our new system to the past customer list.
- **The Result**: 
  1. Fresh content boosts Google SEO rankings (organic traffic).
  2. Newsletters keep the brand "top-of-mind" so customers call YOU when things break, not a competitor.

[TASK]
Write a persuasive, enthusiastic message to the business owner, "Sarah", explaining this value. 
- Tone: Professional, innovative, and results-oriented.
- Highlight the $1,000/year savings immediately.
- Pitch the "Content Loop" (Blog -> Email -> Traffic -> SEO) as the next phase for 2026 growth.
- Keep it concise but punchy.
